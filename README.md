# Horiseon Webpage Accessibility Refactoring

## Description
This project entailed the refactoring of the webpage of a company, Horiseon.  The webpage was refactored in order to increase its accessibility features, improve search engine optimization characteristics, condense repetitive CSS code, and increase the readability of the HTML with semantic elements.  This webpage will now be easier to search for on search engines and will be more accessible to users who are unable to or have difficulty reading directly from their browser.  In addition, the webpage's code will be more easily maintained in the future with semantic elements in the HTML and non-repetitive CSS.
